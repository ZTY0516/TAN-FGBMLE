Tree-Augmented Naïve Bayes (TAN) is valued for its interpretable graphical structure and efficient inference. However, its structure learning for continuous attributes depends on class-conditional mutual information, whose accurate estimation is challenging under complex distributions such as multi-modal, long-tailed, or heteroscedastic cases. To address this, we propose TAN-FGBMLE, a structure learning method based on Fast Generative Bootstrap Maximum Likelihood Estimation. Specifically, we design a generative model with a two-stage framework: in the first stage, resampling weights and random noise are input into the generator to rapidly produce candidate parameters, efficiently covering the latent density space without repeated independent optimization; in the second stage, optimal mixture weights are estimated through maximum likelihood estimation, assigning appropriate contributions to each candidate component. This design enables fast and accurate complex density estimation for both single and joint attributes, providing reliable computation of class-conditional mutual information. The TAN structure is then constructed using Prim’s maximum spanning tree algorithm. Experimental results on benchmark datasets show that TAN-FGBMLE achieves higher density fitting accuracy, lower runtime, and superior classification performance compared to traditional non-parametric estimators. On real-world air quality data, it further demonstrates robustness, improved interpretability, and more meaningful dependency structures among continuous attributes.
